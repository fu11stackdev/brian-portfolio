            description="Developed an adaptive image sampling and reconstruction system for drone-based transmissions using Compressed Sensing and Deep Learning. Designed deep neural networks for optimized mask generation (NetM) and inpainting-based reconstruction (NetE). Integrated real-time mask refinement, ensuring efficient bandwidth usage in constrained environments. Implemented a Streamlit-based graphical interface for real-time monitoring and visualization."

            description="Developed a computer vision system for precise alignment of prehistoric paintings onto a replica of the Chauvet Cave. Utilized Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) to reconstruct a 3D model of the replica. Implemented Zhang's method for projector calibration, treating the projector as an inverted camera. Applied Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and scale correction to align the reconstructed model with the original cave structure. This project optimizes projection accuracy and reduces manual positioning errors."

Implemented progressive vertex removal, constrained Delaunay retriangulation, and adaptive parameterization to optimize mesh complexity while preserving topology. Achieved O(N log N) efficiency for large-scale 3D models, with applications in 3D scanning, texturing, and morphing."

During my preparatory classes, I made a heart rate monitor as a project for my TIPE. The device measured heart rate using a technique called Photoplethysmography. I had to make the sensor using IR LED also photodiode, also I had make the electronic circuit to ensure the output contains only the alternative signal from heart pulse. Finally I did the post-processing using Arduino kit to visualise the heart rate."
